    "The goal of this project is to predict sale price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa based on the given training and test data sets. There are 79 explanatory variables describing different aspects of residential homes with 1460 observations in both training and test data sets (this is different than previous class projects where train data is usually larger than test data set). \n",
    "\n",
    "The output variable (SalePrice) is quantitative (continuous) whereas the explanatory (LHS) variables are a combination of quantitative (continuous) and categorical variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the size and nature of the data set, and informed by our domain understanding, we believe that *feature engineering* -- crafting data features optimized for machine learning -- is key for better modeling for this problem. Specifically, we plan to perform following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Univariate analysis of output and explanatory variables: weed out spurious or wrong values. Understand patterns and outliers for each variable. Allow for missing values (NaN) imputations.\n",
    "- Transform categorical variables into numeric (using dummy variables?)\n",
    "- Check if log transformation of output and explanatory variables helps better model performance\n",
    "- Through bivariate analysis, identify and remove unhelpful explanatory variables (using correlation matrix or using techniques such as LASSO) and multicollinearity (if present)\n",
    "- Advance feature engineering techniques such as PCA?\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have to watch out for overfitting considering there are a large number of input variables (compared to the training data size).\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to begin with (multiple) LinearRegression model (for speed) and if the accuracy is not satisfactory, we would try other models such as random forest and gradient-boosting tree. If needed, we may have to ensemble all these models for better overall accuracy. We will split test data into two random sets and use one as \"dev\" data during model building process."

As Decision tree algorithm does not require any transformation of the features for nonlinear data, there will not be any feature transformation in this section. Since random forests are less sensitive to outliers in the dataset we are assuming at this point that it will not require much parameter tuning. The only parameter that will require experimenting might be number of trees. "
